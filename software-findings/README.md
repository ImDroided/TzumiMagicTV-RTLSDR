# Software Findings
These findings are mostly theories, only states facts are known. More facts will come as I find time to dig deeper into the app.

# The TV App
While I was tearing down the android app to see if there was a nonintrusive way to gain access to the MagicTV, I noticed a lot of stuff about the app <-> device behavior. One aspect that surprised me was that the MagicTV is a lot less magic than you would think. From what I can tell (the code is obfuscated so it's tough), the MagicTV just does what the app tells to, and replies when it asks for something. The channel scan, for example, is just the app asking the MagicTV over and over if there is audio or video. If there is, it asks for channel info, and stores the channel in an array on the phone and moves on. The stream is constantly on port 8000, for whenever the app needs it, and the app constantly asks the MagicTV about signal strength status. When you press the connect button, it simply runs a loin request on the MagicTV and asks the "softwareverion" and what tuner it has.
