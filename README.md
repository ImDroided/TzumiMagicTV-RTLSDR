# TzumiMagicTV RTLSDR
This repo is a hub for modifications and details about the Tzumi MagicTV, a 13 dollar OpenWRT unit with RTL-SDR and a battery. At /r/rtlsdr, we have been working to get access to it. This is an unorganized hub where I am putting my findings and some others on the ##rtlsdr IRC.

# Organization
This repo is split into a simple hierarchy. Mainly divided by hardware and software. There is also a software-findings folder that details observed behaviors with the stock firmware. Finally, there is a mobileApp-android folder with a copy of the mobile app and a teardown.

# License
I specifically chose The Unlicense for this project so anyone can use this work. It is a culmination of my work, and other on the /r/rtlsdr subreddit (including IRC.) Feel free to use what you need, just let us know if you find anything that could help.
